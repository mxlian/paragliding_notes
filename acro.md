# Ground spiral
* Make it asymetric to allow to estimate better
* Exit 120-180 degrees before you desired end direction
* Before the wing touch weight to the outsise then immediately to the inside and add inside brake (i was told by acro pilot)?
* If you exit and you climb back but not high enough, don't try a nice gliding landing. Recovering fly speed take height. Better to deepstall the glider or break hard before touch down if you don't have recovered the ennergy that you lost while climbing after exit

# Wingovers
* Establish reference points
* Lead with weight shift
* Switch body poistion when the tip desn't come any lower (look at the tip of the glider)
* You need to start the turning of the glider in the first arc of the pendulum. If not the glider is behind you, it wont turn quick and you'll loose energy
    ** Too early: gain energy, but not climb high
    ** Too late: looses energy, but climbs more. Not easy to control
    
# Spins
* While doing spins adopt a more compact position. Upper body to the front. Reduces twist danger
* Grab opposite riser
* Putting weight to the flying side will make the spin faster and more aggressive
* Do a progressive slowdown of the flying side to avoid twist. This will train to do a nice heli exit
