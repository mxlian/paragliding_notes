# Ground spiral
* Make it asymetric to allow to estimate better
* Exit 120-180 degrees before you desired end direction
* Before the wing touch weight to the outsise then immediately to the inside and add inside brake (i was told by acro pilot)?
* If you exit and you climb back but not high enough, don't try a nice gliding landing. Recovering fly speed take height. Better to deepstall the glider or break hard before touch down if you don't have recovered the ennergy that you lost while climbing after exit
