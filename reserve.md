## Selecting the reserve

* The use of lightweight materials are ok
* Is not ok lightweight rescues that have smaller surface

## Packing your rescue

TBW

## Throwing the reserve

* It should be done in one movement. Two movements (taking it out then trowing) are generally 
not recomended. *Could it be usefull anyways (SAT like rotation)?*
* If possible try to stop the rotation of the glider before thowing. It will dramatically 
increase the chances of a correct deployment
* Stall the glider (B/C stall recommnded). Do it symetrically (right and left), otherwise it 
will spin and make the twist worse
* Keep it in that position, specially before touching the ground. If you release near the 
ground the glider could restart and put you in a downplane position
* It's not necessary to collect it and stuff the glider it into your legs. But do it if you 
have enough height
* If the rescue not opens or get tangled, pull it from the connection lines to facilitate the 
opening
* Do a [PLF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute_landing_fall) on landing. Practice it!
