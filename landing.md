## Pumping the breaks

* The idea is to reduce the glide angle as much as possible by reaching the stall point and then releasing repeatedly. 
* Pumping without reaching the stall point doesn't make sense. It would be better to fly slowly the whole time without releasing.
* If the glider flys the stall point and you release the breaks fully it will not fall into a full stall (as long it is correctly trimmed and not wet).
* If you fly a wind gradient (very common on landings) after releasing the breaks the glider may remain parachutal, because of the lower wind speed on the lower layers of the gradient. Keep the hands up! Breaking could develop a full stall. Be aware that when the gradient decrese the glider will start flying again and may shoot. It is possible to break the surge but be carefull not to stall it!
* If you hit the brakes on landing and you gain much more height as expected do:
    * When it stills climbing, release a little bit the breaks so the glider catches ups faster and you don't loose so much energy
    * At the end of the climbing phase pull the brakes all the way through if you are less than 3mts from the ground. You have lost a lot of energy in the climbing, you can't make a soft breaking landing anymore


## Thermal
* Be prepared to be taken off by a thermal and inexpectedly gain some height. Have a plan B for it.
* If the thermal is long enough consider turning and taking it
* Avoid to fly near triger points. If a thermal thrigers can be very turbulent.
