# Takeoff

## Preparation
* Check the rescue splints


## Taking off
* Five point check:
    1. Harness buckles closed. Carabiner closed. Helmet closed
    2. Lines are streight, no knots
    3. The glider is in a corret position, 'eintrittskante' is open
    4. Wind direction and strenght are ok
    5. Airspace is free. No gliders above. No obstacles in the starting direction
* Phases:
    1. Bring up
    2. Control
    3. Acceleration

### Bring up
* Define before the start a point or a line for abort. If you don't have your glider flying above you before reaching that predefined imaginary line, then you will perform a controlled abort.
* To start you need to guide the glider above your head, whith your hands PASSIVELY in the A Risers. Don't pull.
The force to start the glider should come from your hips, not from you hands/arms.
* The initial impuls from the hips depend on the wind and on the terrain. The more wind, the less impulse you need. The more flat the gound is, the more impulse you need.
* Breaking in this phase is couterproductive.
**Expert**: If the glider is coming asymetrically, you can correct the symetry by pulling the A's on the lower side to speed it up and help it level up with the other side.

### Control
* This should be perform only with the glider is vertical above the pilot! If done earlier it interrupts the starting phase. Done too late can be dangerous.
* Control the glider pich the same way as active flying
**NOTE:** Corrections on the glider (direction) make sense only whith the glider vertical above the pilot.

### Acceleration
* Pilot acceleration should be progressive to avoid pendulum. 
* Slowly release the breakes as you start walk/run progressively faster.
* Is recomended to do bigger and bigger steps, instead of a lot of very fast steps. On each step there is a moment when the hips go a little bit higher. This induces a small disturbance in the glider, because of a change in the tension of the lines. You want to minimize that.
* Concentrate on keeping your hips at the same level of the ground all the time, to keep the lines allways under tension.

## After take of
* Refrain youself to get immediately in the harness. Keep an upright position until you have at least 50mts ground clearance. Do it! No matter stetic or other pilots!
* After taking off check again visually the glider before doing the first curve.
