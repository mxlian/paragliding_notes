## Glider design

* Asimetrical color designs could lead with the time to asymetrical flying characteristics. This is due different aging on different fabrics. The will eventually have different porosity wich will influence the flying. Bright colors tend to show worse porosity faster than other colors.

## Snap oppening ('Schnalzer')

* Snap oppening are not necessarily a bad thing. The tendency to snap is a characteristic from the glider
* Gliders out of trimm (with a slower trimm) show an increased tendency to snap oppenings after a deflation
