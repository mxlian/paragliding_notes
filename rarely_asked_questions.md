## Spirals

#### Is it possible to always do a fast spiral exit, if you correctly stop the surge?
No yet 100% sure but: Yes. The glider will climb and remain behind the pilot (high angle of attack) until all the energy from the spiral is converted into height (the higher rated the glider the more efficent the conversion will be). Then the glider will 'restart' from behind the pilot and shoot accordingly. You will have to break the surge which depending how you exited the spiral and how you put your weight on the exit will be quite assymetrical.

#### How wind direction influences the exit (head vs tailwind)?
To be answered

#### Doing a spiral fast exit (with massive shotting) prevents flying on your own turbulence?
Yes, because the exit trajectory goes outside the cilinder/cone you were describing with your spiral. You exit almost streigth out of it.

## Undesired states
#### If pumping the breaks on tight landing, you hit the gradient and the glider starts to stall. You release breaks completely. Can the massive gradient make the glider go into full stall?
No, the glider will keep bitting trying to fly again.  - Gary (from XDreamFly)
If the gradient is strong it can remain in parachutal until it can fly again, which can be too close to the ground to allow regaining speed and land softly. So if a gradient situation is expected be aware you can end up landing in a deep stall in the worst case. Which is hard but not that hard.

## Wingover
#### Is it possible to fall into the cannopy while performing this manover?
Yes, if they are high enough and you don't have enough energy

## SAT
#### What happen when you're IN the SAT and you still pull too much brake?
The SAT will loose so much rotational speed and the wing will stall (?) and you will end up in a something like a helico.

#### Why the outside of the wing flutters when the SAT is entere too slowly or not enough weight shifting?
To be answered

## Reserve
#### Throw in one movement or in two steps (take it out, then accelerate and throw)?
If you have enough height and you can do it correctly the two steps can lead to a faster and cleaner openning. If you are in a SAT like autorotation this can be crucial to avoid the rescue being tangled in the lines.
